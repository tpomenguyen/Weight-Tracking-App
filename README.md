# Cplus-Plus-CS360 Easy Weight Tracker App

Easy Weight Tracker App is designed for users to track their weight for daily lifestyle use or goal setting in losing weight.  Users will be able to store their goal and track weight through a stored login with a password. Additionally, users can opt to enable sms messages to be notified to input daily weights and reach their goal.

There are five layouts, the main screen where users can register their accounts and sign in. The edit views screen where the daily weights are displayed, can be edited, or deleted. The weight entry screen where users enter their new weight. The main screen where users can enter a new goal and edit their weight. Lastly, the user setting screen where users can enter their phone number to enable sms messaging or delete their account.

In coding my app I took one step at a time. I first completed a class diagram for the weight tracking app and set the Java class and the tasks that would be completed in that class. While completing the code I completed each class one by one while setting the layout for each class. I used ZyBooks as a reference when completing each layout. 

In order to ensure my test was functional, in the res.layout coding section I was able to first view how the layout would look through the design section. I then used the emulator to run the application to ensure the code and application was functionally running. 
When working on the wight tracking app, working on the application was a whole new learning experience for me. Creating the Java classes was the easy part for me, while the layouts for the app was a challenge. While I had the layout and design down, I had to make sure the code was properly functioning and meshed with the layouts.

While I was most comfortable with the coding aspect of Java classes. I felt my new experience in completing the layout design well particularly well in making a functional weight tracking app.
